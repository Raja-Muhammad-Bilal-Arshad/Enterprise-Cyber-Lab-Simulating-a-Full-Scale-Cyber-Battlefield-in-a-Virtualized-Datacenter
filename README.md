# **Enterprise Cyber Lab:**

# Simulating a Full-Scale Cyber Battlefield in a Virtualized Datacenter

---

##  **Project Overview**

This project recreates an **entire enterprise network** inside a **Proxmox Virtual Environment**, then hardens it using **pfSense firewalls**, **Suricata IDS**, and **Snort IPS**, with **full log forwarding** into **Splunk SIEM** for real-time threat visibility.

Inside this **safe, isolated lab**, we stage a **live cyber battle**:

* **Attackers**: Distributed penetration testing nodes executing coordinated, multi-vector assaults.

* **Victims**: Windows & Linux systems running vulnerable services.

* **Defenders**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and SIEM analysts responding in real-time.

---

##  **Lab Objectives**

* Build a **realistic enterprise network** on virtualized infrastructure.

* Deploy **layered security** using pfSense, Suricata, Snort, and Pi-hole.

* Simulate **real-world cyber attacks** from multiple sources.

* Enable **blue team monitoring** through Splunk SIEM dashboards.

* Provide a **repeatable platform** for testing, training, and research.

---

##  **The Simulation Flow**

1. **Infrastructure Deployment**

   * Proxmox cluster hosts all attack, victim, and security nodes.

   * Segmented networks with pfSense as the gateway.

2. **Security Hardening**

   * Suricata & Snort for deep packet inspection.

   * Pi-hole for DNS filtering & ad/tracker blocking.

   * pfBlockerNG for geographic IP blocking.

3. **Attack Execution**

   * Kali Linux ‚ÄúMajor‚Äù node commands botnet-style ‚ÄúSoldier‚Äù nodes.

   * Custom socket-based flooders, scanners, and exploit scripts.

4. **Defensive Response**

   * IDS signatures trigger alerts.

   * Firewalls block suspicious IPs in real-time.

   * Splunk dashboards light up with events.

5. **Incident Analysis**

   * Timeline reconstruction of the ‚Äúbattle.‚Äù

   * Review of firewall logs, IDS hits, and SIEM correlation.
